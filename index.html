Scarface is a 1983 American crime drama film directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone. It is a remake of the 1932 film and tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug lord. The cast also features Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, F. Murray Abraham, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. <strong>Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop it.</strong>
<br>
Scarface was released on December 9, 1983 and grossed $44 million at the domestic box office and $65.9 million worldwide.<span class="myBitOfCrazyStyling"> Initial critical reception was negative due to excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage.</span> Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers.

<h2>Movie's soundtrack</h2>

<p>Instead of using music from the period in which the film was set,<br> 
the generic music <strong>in Scarface was produced by Academy Award-winning Italian record producer Giorgio Moroder. Reflecting Moroder's style, the soundtrack consists mostly of muzak-like synthesized new wave, electronic music. De Palma says that he has repeatedly denied Universal's requests to release the film with a "pop" score because he feels that Moroder's score is adequate.</strong> Main article: Scarface (soundtrack)

<br>
<em>In 2003, Scarface was remastered and re-released through Universal Records. The 2003 remaster has been criticized for extensively remixing several tracks from the original album. According to De Palma, Universal wanted to change the original soundtrack for a rap score.</em>
